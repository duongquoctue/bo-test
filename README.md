# Block Odyssey

1. In which point, did you feel hard?

- At first, when I look at the data and see the repeatition, I thought that the forward and the backward was the same, and one loop will do the job of indexing both the `from` location and the `to` location. But the results were wrong because it's not the same. So I have to come up with another solution, I was trying to reverse the reFullPath array to again, loop through once but didn't have the time to finish the test

2. If you have more time to do this, what will you improve in your code?
I'll implement the rest of the solution and maybe the `from` and `to` can be searched through only the bus number [01] [02]
