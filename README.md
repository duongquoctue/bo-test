# Block Odyssey

1. In which point, did you feel hard?

- At first, when I look at the data and see the repeatition, I thought that the forward and the backward was the same, and one loop will do the job of indexing both the `from` location and the `to` location. But the results were wrong because it's not the same. So I have to come up with another solution, I was trying to brute force it first but I didn't have the time to finish it.

2. If you have more time to do this, what will you improve in your code?
I'll implement the rest of the brute-force solution and maybe the `from` and `to` can be searched through only the bus number [01] [02]
